		<p>Greetings pilots! Welcome to a slightly earlier report than normal as I make a bid to realign the reports back to a Sunday release (I somehow ended up doing the reports on a Monday during the holidays). All in all, it’s been a quieter week as we get back into the swing of things with the new year however, it’s been great to see an upturn in activity with various flying and fiction activities being completed. </p>
		<p>We are putting forward a team for the Chalquilla Cup II Beer League under the name “Sintoxicated” and are actively looking for two more team members. If you’re interested, then please drop me a message. </p>
		<p>There is currently a huge range of competitions to get involved with, please see the competitions section below for some of the ways you can get involved and participate with fleet activities. </p>
